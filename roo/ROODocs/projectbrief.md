Okay, fantastic! It's great that the core functionality is working well. Planning the next steps is a perfect way to build on this foundation.

You've provided an excellent list of desired features and improvements. I'll organize these into logical groups, starting with foundational/simpler tasks and moving towards more complex features, and elaborate on potential implementation strategies as requested.

While hitting an exact word count like 5000 might make the plan overly verbose, I will aim for significant detail in outlining the steps, considerations, and potential challenges for each enhancement, incorporating your ideas and adding a few suggestions for robustness and maintainability.

Emergency fix:
You're absolutely right. From the perspective of only using ComfyUI, and given how basic the current implementation of the "Custom Endpoint" is (only sending prompt and seed), it really doesn't serve a practical purpose right now.
My explanation was about the potential or intended flexibility – the idea that if someone had a different, very simple API, or if we were to build out that feature much more (allowing custom request bodies, headers, etc.), then it could be useful.
But you are correct, as it stands today in the code:
1. It doesn't work for ComfyUI.
2. It's too generic to work with most other known image generation APIs without significant modification.
Given that we've now made the "Local ComfyUI" option handle different network addresses, the "Custom Endpoint" feature in its current minimal state is mostly just adding confusion.
Recommendation:
It probably makes sense to remove the "Custom Endpoint" functionality entirely for now to simplify the interface and avoid confusion. This would involve:
* Removing the "Add Custom Endpoint" button from index.html.
* Removing the #custom-endpoints-list div from index.html.
* Removing the case 'custom_image': block from the switch statement inside the callImageGenerationAPI function in script.js.
* Removing the addCustomImageEndpointInput and handleRemoveCustomEndpoint functions from script.js.
* Removing the related event listeners in addEventListeners.
Would you like me to provide the updated index.html and script.js files with that "Custom Endpoint" functionality completely removed?

## Prompt Forge V2 - Enhancement Plan

Here's a proposed plan, grouping your requests and adding implementation details:

**Phase 1: Project Setup, Documentation & Basic Polish (Low Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Ensure the project is well-documented, correctly structured for sharing, and includes minor immediate fixes.
* **Rationale:** Proper documentation is essential for maintainability and for others who might use or contribute to the project. Basic setup files are standard practice.

1.  **Finalize `README.md` File for GitHub Repo**
    * **Goal:** Create a comprehensive and well-formatted README file.
    * **Status:** A draft was provided previously.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Review the draft README provided earlier.
        * Update the "Features" section to accurately reflect the *current* working state (including `localStorage` for API key, LAN address input for ComfyUI).
        * Add a clear "Setup" section explaining:
            * Cloning the repo.
            * The need for a local web server (like `python -m http.server`) to avoid potential CORS issues when accessing local APIs (ComfyUI, LM Studio, Ollama), even if `file:///` works for basic UI interaction.
            * How to configure the necessary inputs (LLM endpoint, API Key, ComfyUI LAN Address, Workflow selection).
        * Add a "Usage" section explaining the workflow (select keywords, generate summary, optionally refine with LLM, select prompt source, select image endpoint(s), send).
        * **Add a "Logo":** You mentioned "Make a Logo w/ prompt". This is an external creative task. Once you have a logo image (e.g., hosted on GitHub itself or another image service), add it prominently near the top of the README using Markdown image syntax: `![Project Logo](URL_TO_LOGO_IMAGE)`
        * **Add a Screenshot:** Replace the placeholder screenshot URL with a real one showing the application interface.
        * **License Section:** Ensure the License section accurately reflects the `LICENSE` file you added to the repository.
        * Add sections for "Contributing" (if you plan to accept contributions) and "Troubleshooting" (mentioning common issues like CORS, firewall, server not running).
    * **Affected Files:** `README.md`
    * **Complexity:** Low

2.  **Confirm `requirements.txt` (Not Applicable)**
    * **Goal:** Address the `requirements.txt` request.
    * **Status:** Addressed previously.
    * **Implementation:** Add a note in the `README.md` explicitly stating that this is a client-side application (HTML/CSS/JS) and does not require a Python `requirements.txt` file for installation or use. Explain that dependencies are browser-based.
    * **Affected Files:** `README.md`
    * **Complexity:** Very Low

3.  **Verify `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`**
    * **Goal:** Ensure standard project files are present and correct.
    * **Status:** `.gitignore` draft provided, user decided on license previously.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Confirm a `.gitignore` file exists in the root directory and includes entries to ignore `data.js` (or any other files potentially containing secrets) and common OS/editor files.
        * Confirm a `LICENSE` file exists in the root directory containing the text of the chosen open-source license (e.g., MIT).
    * **Affected Files:** `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (existence check)
    * **Complexity:** Very Low

**Phase 2: UI Layout Adjustments (Low Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Rearrange UI elements in the configuration section for better logical flow, as requested.
* **Rationale:** Improves user experience by grouping related actions and information more intuitively.

1.  **Reposition "Generate API Prompt" Button**
    * **Goal:** Move the "Generate API Prompt" button directly *above* the "API Generated Prompt" textarea.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`index.html`:** Cut the `<button type="button" id="generateApiPromptButton" ...>` element from its current location (likely end of LLM config subsection) and paste it immediately *before* the `div` with `id="api-prompt-output-container"`. Ensure it's still logically within the LLM configuration flow, perhaps just before the output it generates. Consider if it should remain inside the collapsible LLM section or be moved outside/below it, adjacent to its output. Placing it right above the output field seems logical.
        * **`styles.css`:** Adjust margins if needed (e.g., add `margin-bottom` to the button or `margin-top` to the textarea container) to ensure adequate spacing. Remove the `subsection-action-button` class if it's no longer centered at the bottom of its subsection.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** Low

2.  **Reposition "Send Prompt / Start Batch" Button**
    * **Goal:** Move the "Send Prompt / Start Batch" button (`#sendPromptButton`) to be under the "API Generated Prompt" field.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`index.html`:** This is tricky. The "Send Prompt" button logically belongs with the *Image Generation* configuration, not the LLM configuration. Placing it under the API prompt field mixes concerns. A better interpretation might be to place the *Image Generation Configuration* section below the API prompt field, and keep the "Send Prompt" button within *that* section.
        * **Alternative Interpretation:** If the user *really* wants the Send button physically separated and placed below the API prompt field (before the Image Gen config), cut the `<button type="button" id="sendPromptButton" ...>` and the stop button `<button type="button" id="stopBatchButton" ...>` from the Image Generation Config subsection and paste them *after* the `div` with `id="api-prompt-output-container"` but *before* the start of the Image Generation Config subsection. This would likely require adding a new container `div` for them.
        * **Recommendation:** Keep the "Send/Start Batch" button logically tied to the Image Generation settings it controls (Option 1 - no move needed, just ensure sections are ordered correctly). If section ordering is the goal, proceed with step 3 below. If the button *must* move physically, implement the Alternative Interpretation.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `styles.css` (if moved)
    * **Complexity:** Low (if no move) / Medium (if moved, due to potential layout adjustments)

3.  **Position Image Generation Configuration**
    * **Goal:** Place the "Image Generation Configuration" settings *beneath* the "Send Prompt / Start Batch" button location (which likely means beneath the API Generated Prompt field, following the logic from step 2).
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`index.html`:** Ensure the main `div` containing the "Image Generation Configuration" subsection (the one with the collapsible button `aria-controls="image-gen-config-content"`) comes *after* the `div` containing the "API Generated Prompt" output (`id="api-prompt-output-container"`). This involves rearranging the main subsections within the `config-action-area`.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`
    * **Complexity:** Low

4.  **Set Default Prompt Source to "API Generated Prompt"**
    * **Goal:** Change the default selection in the "Select Prompt to Send" radio group.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`index.html`:** In the `prompt-send-selector` fieldset, find the two radio inputs (`#send-keywords`, `#send-api-prompt`). Remove the `checked` attribute from `#send-keywords` and add it to `#send-api-prompt`.
            ```html
             <div class="send-option"><input type="radio" id="send-keywords" name="promptToSend" value="keywords"><label for="send-keywords">Keywords Summary</label></div>
             <div class="send-option"><input type="radio" id="send-api-prompt" name="promptToSend" value="api" checked><label for="send-api-prompt">API Generated Prompt</label></div>
            ```
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`
    * **Complexity:** Very Low

**Phase 3: Core Functionality Enhancements (Medium Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Improve existing core features like randomization and user configuration options.
* **Rationale:** Addresses user feedback on current limitations and improves the usability of core interactions.

1.  **Improve "Feeling Lucky" Randomization**
    * **Goal:** Make the random selection feel more "even" or perhaps more useful than purely random selection across all categories.
    * **Rationale:** Purely random selection might often omit crucial categories (like Subject) or over-select less impactful ones.
    * **Implementation Options:**
        * **a) Weighted Categories:** Assign weights to categories. Core categories like "Subject Matter" and "Artistic Style" could have a higher probability of having at least one item selected. Less critical categories could have lower weights or a higher chance of having zero items selected.
            * **`script.js` (`handleFeelLucky`):** Modify the logic. Instead of a flat `Math.random() * 7` for quantity per category, introduce a weight map (e.g., `{ subjectMatter: 0.9, artisticStyle: 0.8, locationSetting: 0.6, ... }`). Use `Math.random()` compared against the weight to decide *if* a category gets any items selected (e.g., `if (Math.random() < categoryWeights[categoryId]) { ... select items ... }`). Then, within selected categories, perhaps select 1-3 items instead of 0-6.
        * **b) Guaranteed Core Selection:** Ensure at least one item is always selected from essential categories (e.g., Subject, Style) before randomly selecting from others.
            * **`script.js` (`handleFeelLucky`):** Add specific steps at the beginning to pick one random item from `subjectMatter` and `artisticStyle`. Then loop through the *remaining* categories with the existing (or adjusted) random quantity logic.
        * **c) User-Configurable Weights (Advanced - see Phase 7):** Allow users to set weights/priorities themselves (links to a later enhancement).
    * **Initial Recommendation:** Option (b) is likely the simplest effective improvement. Ensure core elements are present, then randomize the rest.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js` (`handleFeelLucky` function)
    * **Complexity:** Medium (requires careful logic changes and potentially restructuring the randomization steps)

2.  **Refine ComfyUI Endpoint Selection UI/Logic**
    * **Goal:** Simplify the ComfyUI selection based on the user's feedback ("no need to select local comfy, its the only option.. should select location...").
    * **Rationale:** The current checkbox + separate address field might be slightly clunky if ComfyUI is the primary/only complex endpoint.
    * **Implementation Idea:**
        * **`index.html`:** Replace the "Local ComfyUI" checkbox (`#img-comfyui`) and the "Server Address" input (`#comfyuiLanAddress`) with a **Radio Button Group** for "ComfyUI Location":
            ```html
            <fieldset class="radio-group-vertical" id="comfyui-location-selector">
                <legend>ComfyUI Server Location:</legend>
                <div class="radio-option">
                    <input type="radio" name="comfyuiLocation" id="comfy-location-local" value="local" checked>
                    <label for="comfy-location-local">On this Machine (http://127.0.0.1:8188)</label>
                </div>
                <div class="radio-option">
                    <input type="radio" name="comfyuiLocation" id="comfy-location-lan" value="lan">
                    <label for="comfy-location-lan">On Local Network (LAN):</label>
                    <input type="text" id="comfyuiLanAddressInline" placeholder="http://192.168.x.x:8188" class="inline-text-input">
                </div>
                </fieldset>
             <div class="comfy-workflow-select"> <label for="comfyWorkflowSelect" class="inline-label">Workflow:</label>
                 <select id="comfyWorkflowSelect" class="api-select small-select">...</select>
             </div>
            ```
        * **`styles.css`:** Add styles for `#comfyui-location-selector`, `.radio-group-vertical`, and `.inline-text-input` to make it look good.
        * **`script.js` (`getSelectedImageEndpoints`):**
            * Remove the check for the `#img-comfyui` checkbox.
            * Check which radio button (`#comfy-location-local` or `#comfy-location-lan`) is selected.
            * If `#comfy-location-local` is selected, add the endpoint with URL `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.
            * If `#comfy-location-lan` is selected, read the address from `#comfyuiLanAddressInline`, validate it, and use that URL (or potentially show an error/don't add if invalid/empty).
    * **Consideration:** This removes the ability to *disable* ComfyUI easily other than by selecting a custom endpoint instead. Is that acceptable? The user implied ComfyUI was the main focus. This approach makes selecting the address more direct. We also lose the ability to select ComfyUI *and* custom endpoints simultaneously easily.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** Medium (requires careful UI and logic changes for endpoint selection)

3.  **Save/Load Custom Image Endpoints**
    * **Goal:** Persist the list of custom image generation endpoints added by the user.
    * **Rationale:** Avoids users having to re-enter custom URLs every time they load the page.
    * **Implementation:** Similar to saving the API key.
        * **`script.js`:**
            * Use `localStorage`. Define a storage key (e.g., `promptForgeCustomEndpoints`).
            * **`saveCustomEndpoints` function:** Get all URLs from the inputs within `#custom-endpoints-list`. Store them as a JSON array string in `localStorage`. Call this function whenever an endpoint is added or potentially removed (or maybe on blur of the input fields).
            * **`loadCustomEndpoints` function:** Called during initialization (`DOMContentLoaded`). Get the JSON string from `localStorage`, parse it. If valid, iterate through the saved URLs and call `addCustomImageEndpointInput` (or a modified version) for each one to recreate the UI elements.
            * **Modify `addCustomImageEndpointInput`:** Ensure it doesn't *automatically* trigger a save; saving should happen separately (e.g., on input blur or a dedicated "Save Endpoints" button).
            * **Modify `handleRemoveCustomEndpoint`:** After removing the UI element, call `saveCustomEndpoints` to update storage.
        * **`index.html`:** No major changes needed initially, unless adding a specific "Save Endpoints" button is preferred over auto-saving.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Medium

4.  **Save/Recall Last Used LAN Address (Cookie/localStorage)**
    * **Goal:** Pre-fill the ComfyUI LAN address field with the last successfully used address.
    * **Rationale:** Convenience for users who frequently use the same remote ComfyUI server.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`script.js`:**
            * Use `localStorage` (more persistent than cookies for this). Define a storage key (e.g., `promptForgeLastLanAddress`).
            * **Modify `handleSendPromptToImageServices` (or `getSelectedImageEndpoints`):** When using the LAN address from the input (`#comfyuiLanAddress` or `#comfyuiLanAddressInline` depending on previous step's implementation), *after* validation, save the *valid* address to `localStorage` using the new key.
            * **Modify Initialization (`DOMContentLoaded`):** After DOM refs are set, *before* loading the API key, try loading the last LAN address from `localStorage`. If found, populate the corresponding input field (`#comfyuiLanAddress` or `#comfyuiLanAddressInline`).
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Low to Medium (integrates with existing `localStorage` usage).

**Phase 4: Image Results & Metadata Handling (Medium-High Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Enhance the display and utility of generated images and provide more context about their creation.
* **Rationale:** Allows users to inspect results more closely and understand the parameters that produced them.

1.  **Clickable Full-Screen Image Previews**
    * **Goal:** Allow users to click on a generated thumbnail to view a larger version, potentially full-screen or in a modal overlay.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`script.js` (`updateImageResultItem` or Event Delegation):**
            * When an image (`<img>`) is added to the grid, attach a click event listener to it.
            * The listener should trigger a function (`showImageModal` or similar).
            * **`showImageModal` function:**
                * Create modal overlay elements dynamically (a background div, an image container, a close button).
                * Set the `src` of the modal image container to the `src` of the clicked thumbnail.
                * Add CSS classes to display the modal (e.g., using `display: flex`, `position: fixed`, high `z-index`).
                * Add a listener to the close button or overlay background to hide the modal elements.
        * **`styles.css`:** Add CSS for the modal overlay (background color/opacity, centering), the image container (max width/height, maybe `object-fit: contain`), and the close button.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** Medium

2.  **Display Image Generation Metadata**
    * **Goal:** Show detailed parameters associated with each generated image.
    * **Rationale:** Essential for reproducibility, debugging, and understanding results.
    * **Implementation Challenges:** The *availability* of this metadata depends heavily on the image generation endpoint.
        * **ComfyUI:** ComfyUI's `/history/<prompt_id>` endpoint *does* return the full workflow JSON used, including node inputs like seed, steps, cfg, sampler, scheduler, models, resolution etc. [cite: based on ComfyUI API knowledge]. It *doesn't* typically return generation duration directly in the history, nor model release dates or quantization methods unless those are part of node inputs/outputs in the specific workflow. File system location and size are also usually handled server-side.
        * **Custom Endpoints:** Availability depends entirely on what the custom API chooses to return in its response.
    * **Implementation Steps:**
        * **`script.js` (`pollComfyHistory` - modified):**
            * When outputs are found for a `promptId`, parse the `historyData[promptId]` object.
            * Extract relevant parameters *from the workflow structure* within the history data. This requires knowing the node IDs or titles for KSampler (seed, steps, cfg, sampler_name, scheduler, denoise [cite: `WORK/data.js` - KSampler node "31"]), Empty Latent (width, height [cite: `WORK/data.js` - node "27"]), Loaders (unet_name, vae_name, clip_names [cite: `WORK/data.js` - nodes "40","41","42"]), Guidance (guidance value [cite: `WORK/data.js` - node "35"]), and the original prompt text [cite: `WORK/data.js` - node "6"]).
            * Store this extracted metadata, perhaps in a JS object associated with the image result.
        * **`script.js` (`callImageGenerationAPI` - custom):**
            * If the custom endpoint returns metadata in its JSON response, parse and store it.
        * **`script.js` (`updateImageResultItem`):**
            * Modify this function to accept the metadata object.
            * Create new DOM elements (`<p>`, `<span>`, `<ul>`) within the `.image-result-item` div to display the metadata. Format it readably (e.g., key-value pairs).
            * Potentially hide metadata by default and show it on hover/click or in the full-screen modal view.
        * **Metadata Wishlist vs. Reality:** Clearly communicate in the UI which metadata points are *actually available* from the source. Don't show placeholders for things like "Release Date" or "Quantization Method" unless the workflow/API specifically provides them. Generation time is tricky; it might require timing the polling duration as a rough estimate for ComfyUI.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, `styles.css` (for metadata display)
    * **Complexity:** High (Requires parsing complex/variable ComfyUI history JSON, handling potentially missing data from custom endpoints, and significant UI updates for display).

3.  **Option to Download Generated Images**
    * **Goal:** Allow users to save the generated images directly to their local machine.
    * **Rationale:** Core usability feature.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`script.js` (`updateImageResultItem`):**
            * When an image is successfully displayed (either via `imageData` or `imageUrl`), add a small "Download" button or icon link next to or below the image thumbnail inside the `.image-result-item`.
            * **If `imageData` (Base64/Data URL):** The download link's `href` can be set directly to the `imageData`. Set the `download` attribute to suggest a filename (e.g., `download="prompt-forge-image-${Date.now()}.png"`).
            * **If `imageUrl`:** This is trickier due to CORS if the image URL is on a different domain than the app.
                * *Ideal (If CORS allows):* Fetch the `imageUrl`, convert the response to a `blob`, create an object URL (`URL.createObjectURL(blob)`), and set the download link's `href` to the object URL, using the `download` attribute. Remember to revoke the object URL later (`URL.revokeObjectURL(href)`).
                * *Fallback (If CORS blocks fetch):* The download button might just have to be a direct link (`<a href="imageUrl" target="_blank" download="suggested_filename.png">...</a>`). This relies on the browser's behavior for downloading cross-origin linked images, which might just open it in a new tab depending on server headers. Fetching and creating a blob URL is more reliable if possible.
        * **`styles.css`:** Style the download button/link.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** Medium (Handling the `imageUrl` case with potential CORS issues adds complexity).

4.  **Link to Previously Generated Images**
    * **Goal:** Allow users to view images generated in previous sessions or earlier in the current session.
    * **Rationale:** Useful for finding past results without regenerating.
    * **Implementation Challenges:** Requires persistent storage of image data or references. `localStorage` has size limits (typically 5-10MB total per origin) which is quickly exceeded by image data.
    * **Implementation Options:**
        * **a) `sessionStorage` (Current Session Only):** Store image `imageData` (data URLs) or `imageUrl` along with metadata in `sessionStorage`. Display a separate "Session History" section. Cleared when tab closes. Subject to storage limits.
        * **b) `localStorage` (Limited Persistence):** Store only `imageUrl` and metadata (not image data) in `localStorage`. Display a history list. Images might become unavailable if the source URL expires or changes. Still subject to storage limits, but text data takes less space.
        * **c) IndexedDB (Robust Client-Side Storage):** A more complex browser database API suitable for larger amounts of data. Store `imageData` (as Blobs) and metadata. Allows querying. Much more complex to implement than localStorage.
        * **d) Server-Side Storage (Outside Current Scope):** Requires a backend to store image references or data associated with a user account.
    * **Recommendation:** Start with option (b) - storing URLs and metadata in `localStorage`. It provides some persistence without excessive complexity or immediate storage overflow, but with the caveat that images might become inaccessible. Add UI elements (e.g., a "History" button/panel) to display saved items. Implement functionality to load/display data from storage and potentially clear the history.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** High (Requires significant changes for storage management, UI display, and handling potentially broken image links).

**Phase 5: Batch Processing & UI Feedback (Medium-High Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Improve the batch generation experience and provide better feedback during long operations.
* **Rationale:** Makes batch mode more usable and informative.

1.  **Batch Size Option for Individual Prompts**
    * **Goal:** Allow specifying `batch_size` when sending a prompt to the image generation endpoint (primarily ComfyUI).
    * **Rationale:** Allows generating multiple variations of the *same* prompt in one go, which ComfyUI supports.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`index.html`:** Add a number input field (e.g., `id="batchSizeInput"`, default 1, min 1) within the "Image Generation Configuration" section.
        * **`script.js` (`callImageGenerationAPI` - ComfyUI case):**
            * Read the value from `#batchSizeInput`.
            * Find the "Empty Latent Image" node in the `workflowToUse` object (e.g., node "27" in the example [cite: `WORK/data.js`]).
            * Modify its `inputs.batch_size` property to the value read from the input field.
        * **Considerations:** How does this interact with the "Continuous Generation" feature? Continuous Generation currently runs *different* prompts sequentially. This batch size feature would run the *same* prompt multiple times in parallel within *one* ComfyUI execution. They might need separate UI controls or clearer explanations. Perhaps rename "Continuous Generation" to "Sequential Generation" and add this as "Batch Size per Prompt".
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Medium (Requires modifying workflow JSON dynamically, potential UI clarity issues).

2.  **Ensure API Prompt is Default for Batch Submission**
    * **Goal:** Address user feedback that Keywords might be used for batches.
    * **Rationale:** API-refined prompts are likely better suited for batch variations.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`script.js` (`startContinuousGenerationLoop`):** Double-check the logic that determines `promptForThisRun`. Ensure that it correctly uses the output of `handleGenerateApiPrompt` as intended by the logic flow for the selected modes (`keep_keywords_new_api`, `new_lucky_api`). The current logic seems designed to do this already, but careful review/testing is needed. If the user *explicitly* selected "Keywords Summary" in the UI before starting the batch, should it override this? Perhaps disable the prompt source selection when continuous mode is enabled and force it to use the API prompt generated in each loop iteration?
        * **Clarification:** Add UI text explaining that batch mode always uses a newly generated API prompt based on the selected batch mode's keyword strategy.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, potentially `index.html` (for clarification text).
    * **Complexity:** Low (mostly verification and potentially disabling UI elements).

3.  **Better Wait / Countdown Timer**
    * **Goal:** Provide more informative feedback during ComfyUI polling or long API calls.
    * **Rationale:** Improves user experience over a static "Polling..." message.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`script.js` (`pollComfyHistory`):** Instead of just updating the status text with `Polling... (attempts/maxAttempts)`, calculate elapsed time or estimate remaining time (difficult).
            * *Simple:* Show elapsed time: Store `startTime = Date.now()` when polling begins. In the interval, calculate `elapsedSeconds = Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000)`. Update status text to `Polling... (${elapsedSeconds}s)`.
            * *Advanced (Estimate - Very Hard):* ComfyUI doesn't easily expose progress percentage via the history API. Websockets might offer more detail, but that's a major architecture change. A very rough estimate could be based on average time for previous generations, but highly unreliable.
        * **`script.js` (`updateImageResultItem`):** Ensure the status message area can accommodate slightly longer text.
        * **Recommendation:** Implement the simple elapsed time display.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Low (for elapsed time) / Very High (for accurate progress/countdown).

4.  **Slideshow While Waiting**
    * **Goal:** Display a visual distraction (slideshow of previous images?) during generation waits.
    * **Rationale:** Makes waiting less tedious.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Requires the "Link to Previously Generated Images" feature (Phase 4, Item 4) to be implemented first to have images to display.
        * **`index.html`:** Add a container element for the slideshow overlay (initially hidden).
        * **`styles.css`:** Style the overlay (e.g., full screen, semi-transparent background) and the image container within it. Add basic fade-in/out transitions.
        * **`script.js`:**
            * When polling starts (`handleSendPromptToImageServices` or `pollComfyHistory` initiation), if images are available from storage (e.g., `localStorage` URLs):
                * Show the slideshow overlay.
                * Start a `setInterval` timer.
                * Inside the timer, pick the next image URL from storage and set it as the `src` of the slideshow image container. Cycle through available images.
            * When polling finishes or fails for *all* jobs, hide the slideshow overlay and clear the interval timer.
    * **Dependencies:** History/Storage of previous images.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Medium-High (Depends on history implementation, requires careful state management for showing/hiding and timer control).

5.  **Advanced Slideshow Effects (Filters, Transitions, Zooms)**
    * **Goal:** Add visual flair to the waiting slideshow.
    * **Rationale:** Enhances the visual distraction.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **CSS:** Use CSS transitions and animations (`transition`, `animation`, `@keyframes`) for effects like fades, simple zooms (using `transform: scale()`), pans (using `transform: translate()`), or cross-fades (managing opacity of two overlapping image elements).
        * **JS:** Control the application of CSS classes to trigger animations/transitions at intervals. For complex effects (like Ken Burns zoom/pan), JS would need to dynamically calculate and apply `transform` styles over time. Filter effects (`filter: blur(...)`, `filter: grayscale(...)`) can also be applied via CSS/JS.
    * **Dependencies:** Basic Slideshow feature.
    * **Affected Files:** `styles.css`, `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** High (CSS animations can be complex, dynamic JS control adds more).

6.  **Sync Slideshow to Music**
    * **Goal:** Synchronize slideshow transitions/effects with background music.
    * **Rationale:** Creates a more engaging waiting experience.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Music:** Requires adding an audio source (e.g., `<audio>` tag in HTML pointing to royalty-free music files or potentially integrating with a streaming API - which adds significant complexity and legal considerations).
        * **Sync Logic (JS):** Use the Web Audio API to analyze the music's beat or frequency data in real-time (complex) OR pre-define transition timings that match a specific music track's tempo/structure (simpler but less flexible). Trigger slideshow changes (image switches, effect applications) based on detected beats or timed cues.
    * **Dependencies:** Advanced Slideshow feature, Audio source.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`
    * **Complexity:** Very High (Web Audio API analysis is non-trivial, music licensing/selection adds overhead).

**Phase 6: Advanced Workflow Interaction & Customization (High - Very High Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Allow users to directly modify parameters within the selected ComfyUI workflow before execution.
* **Rationale:** Provides much finer control over the generation process beyond just the text prompt. This moves towards a more complete ComfyUI frontend replacement.

1.  **Ability to Modify Workflow Parts (Basic Parameters)**
    * **Goal:** Allow changing resolution, sampler, scheduler, CFG, steps, denoise, guidance.
    * **Rationale:** Core parameter tuning.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **UI (`index.html`):** Add input fields/sliders/dropdowns for each parameter within the "Image Generation Configuration" section (likely near the workflow selector).
        * **Workflow Parsing (`script.js`):** When a workflow is selected from the dropdown, the `callImageGenerationAPI` function needs to:
            * Parse the workflow JSON string (`JSON.parse`).
            * *Identify* the relevant nodes (e.g., KSampler, Empty Latent Image, Guidance node). This might require assuming standard node IDs (like "31", "27", "35" from the example [cite: `WORK/data.js`]) or implementing a more robust search based on `class_type` or `_meta.title`.
            * Read the current default values *from* the parsed workflow for these parameters and potentially populate the new UI input fields.
        * **Workflow Modification (`script.js` - `callImageGenerationAPI`):** Before sending the API request:
            * Read the user's desired values from the new UI input fields.
            * Modify the corresponding `inputs` within the `workflowToUse` JSON object (the deep copy) before stringifying it for the `/prompt` API call. For example, update `workflowToUse["31"].inputs.steps`, `workflowToUse["31"].inputs.cfg`, `workflowToUse["27"].inputs.width`, etc.
    * **Challenges:** Reliably identifying the correct nodes in arbitrary workflows. Handling different data types (numbers, strings). Providing sensible ranges/options for sliders/dropdowns.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`
    * **Complexity:** High

2.  **Swap Models/VAEs/CLIPs**
    * **Goal:** Allow selecting different model files (UNet, VAE, CLIP) within the workflow.
    * **Rationale:** Fundamental for changing the generation style/output.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Model Discovery:** The frontend needs a way to know which models are available on the ComfyUI backend. This isn't easily exposed via the standard `/prompt` or `/history` API. Requires either:
            * Hardcoding known model filenames in `data.js` (inflexible).
            * User manually entering model filenames.
            * Calling a potential ComfyUI API endpoint that lists models (e.g., `/object_info` might list node types, but maybe not specific filenames readily? Requires investigation or custom backend node).
            * Reading filenames from a configuration file the user manages.
        * **UI (`index.html`):** Add dropdown menus for UNet, VAE, CLIP models, populated based on the discovery method chosen.
        * **Workflow Modification (`script.js` - `callImageGenerationAPI`):** Similar to basic parameters, identify the loader nodes (UnetLoader, VAELoader, CLIPLoader/DualCLIPLoader - e.g., "40", "41", "42" [cite: `WORK/data.js`]) in the `workflowToUse` JSON. Update their `inputs` (e.g., `unet_name`, `vae_name`, `clip_name1/2`) with the values selected from the new UI dropdowns.
    * **Challenges:** Model discovery is the main hurdle. Ensuring compatibility between selected models.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`, potentially `data.js` (if hardcoding models).
    * **Complexity:** High (due to model discovery challenge).

3.  **Add Support for LoRA / ControlNet / Inpaint / Upscale**
    * **Goal:** Integrate more advanced ComfyUI features.
    * **Rationale:** Significantly expands creative possibilities.
    * **Implementation:**
        * This likely requires **dynamically modifying the workflow graph**, not just input values. For example, adding a LoRA requires inserting a "Load LoRA" node and connecting it between the model loader and the sampler. ControlNet requires adding CN loader, preprocessor, and apply nodes, connecting images/conditioning. Inpainting needs mask inputs and different sampler settings. Upscaling involves adding upscale models and nodes after the VAE Decode.
        * **Option A (Predefined Workflows):** Create separate, complete workflow JSON strings in `data.js` for *each combination* of features (e.g., "Base + LoRA", "Base + ControlNet", "Base + LoRA + ControlNet"). The UI selects the desired *complete* workflow. This is simpler but less flexible.
        * **Option B (Dynamic Graph Modification - VERY Complex):** Develop sophisticated JS logic to:
            * Parse the base workflow JSON.
            * Identify connection points.
            * Programmatically create JSON representations of new nodes (Load LoRA, Apply ControlNet, etc.).
            * Insert these nodes into the workflow object, correctly updating input/output references (the `["node_id", output_index]` arrays) of connected nodes.
            * Requires deep understanding of ComfyUI node graph structure and careful manipulation of the JSON.
        * **UI (`index.html`):** Need inputs for LoRA selection (similar discovery issue as models), ControlNet model/preprocessor selection, image inputs for ControlNet/Inpaint/Img2Img, mask inputs, upscale model selection, etc.
    * **Recommendation:** Start with Option A (Predefined Workflows) if needed, as Option B is a *major* undertaking akin to building a visual node editor in JS.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`, `data.js` (heavily if using Option A).
    * **Complexity:** Very High (especially Option B).

4.  **Image-to-Image Capabilities**
    * **Goal:** Allow providing an input image to influence generation.
    * **Rationale:** Standard diffusion model feature.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Requires changes similar to ControlNet/Inpaint. Needs an image input mechanism.
        * **UI (`index.html`):** Add a file input (`<input type="file" accept="image/*">`) or drag-and-drop area to upload an initial image.
        * **Image Upload (`script.js`):** When an image is provided:
            * Read the image data (e.g., as Base64).
            * Use the ComfyUI `/upload/image` API endpoint to upload the image to the server. This is a separate API call needed *before* queueing the prompt. The response will provide a filename/subfolder on the server.
            * Modify the `workflowToUse` JSON to include or modify a "Load Image" node, setting its `image` input to the filename returned by the upload API.
            * Connect this Load Image node appropriately (e.g., to a VAE Encode node, or directly to an Img2Img sampler if the workflow supports it).
            * Adjust sampler settings (e.g., lower `denoise` value).
    * **Challenges:** Handling image uploads via API, dynamic workflow modification (finding/adding Load Image node, connecting it, adjusting denoise).
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`.
    * **Complexity:** High.

5.  **Text Embedding via ControlNet (?)**
    * **Clarification Needed:** "Text embedding via control net" is ambiguous. ControlNet typically uses *images* (like Canny edges, depth maps, poses) as control inputs. If the goal is to use *text* to control specific aspects *like* ControlNet (e.g., using text to define a pose or layout), this usually involves different techniques or multi-stage generation, not directly feeding text to a standard ControlNet Apply node. If it means using CLIP Text Encode nodes to influence conditioning, the app already does this for the main prompt. Needs clarification on the specific desired functionality. Assuming it means using text prompts to generate conditioning similar to how image preprocessors work for ControlNet - this would likely involve complex multi-stage workflows or specific custom nodes/models not part of base ComfyUI.
    * **Complexity:** High to Very High (depending on clarification).

6.  **Provide Guidance on Settings/Combinations**
    * **Goal:** Help users understand normal values and good combinations for parameters.
    * **Rationale:** Improves usability for less experienced users.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **UI Tooltips/Placeholders (`index.html`):** Add `title` attributes to input fields or small `(?)` icons with pop-up help explaining parameters (e.g., "CFG: How strongly the prompt influences the image. Typical values 5-10."). Add placeholder text in number inputs showing typical ranges.
        * **Info Section (`index.html`/`script.js`):** Add a dedicated collapsible "Hints & Tips" section. Could include static text or potentially dynamically show tips based on the selected workflow or models (difficult).
        * **Slider Concept (`index.html`/`script.js`):** The "slider from random to structured" idea is interesting. Could be a meta-parameter that adjusts multiple settings simultaneously (e.g., lower CFG, more random prompt elements vs. higher CFG, more structured prompt). Requires defining these presets and how they map to underlying parameters.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js` (for dynamic tips/slider logic), `styles.css`.
    * **Complexity:** Low (for tooltips) / Medium (for info section) / High (for dynamic tips or meta-slider).

7.  **Estimated Generation Time**
    * **Goal:** Show an estimate of how long generation might take.
    * **Rationale:** Manage user expectations.
    * **Implementation Challenges:** Extremely difficult to estimate accurately. Depends on: specific model, resolution, steps, sampler, backend hardware (CPU/GPU), current server load, network latency (for polling).
    * **Implementation Ideas (Rough Estimates Only):**
        * Store average completion times for *past* successful generations (using similar parameters) in `localStorage`. Requires tracking start/end times (e.g., from polling start to image received). Highly unreliable.
        * Make assumptions based on steps/resolution (e.g., more steps = longer). Very inaccurate.
        * Query a potential ComfyUI status endpoint *if one exists* that provides queue position or progress (unlikely via standard HTTP API, might need WebSockets).
    * **Recommendation:** Likely not feasible to implement accurately without significant backend changes or WebSocket integration. Could add a disclaimer like "Generation time varies greatly depending on settings and server load."
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js` (if attempting estimates).
    * **Complexity:** Very High / Potentially Not Feasible.

8.  **MLX Options**
    * **Goal:** Integrate with Apple's MLX framework.
    * **Rationale:** Leverage Apple Silicon's ML capabilities.
    * **Implementation:** MLX runs locally on macOS. Integrating it would likely mean:
        * **Option A (Server):** Running a separate MLX-based inference server (similar to ComfyUI/Ollama) and adding it as a "Custom Endpoint". The Prompt Forge app wouldn't change much.
        * **Option B (Direct Integration - Highly Unlikely):** Trying to run MLX inference *directly within the browser* using WebAssembly or future web ML technologies. Currently likely impractical for complex diffusion models.
    * **Recommendation:** Treat MLX as a potential *backend* option, configurable via the Custom Endpoint URL (Option A). Requires the user to set up and run an MLX inference server separately.
    * **Affected Files:** Documentation (`README.md`) explaining how to use an MLX server as a custom endpoint.
    * **Complexity:** Low (for documentation) / Very High (if attempting direct browser integration).

**Phase 7: Experimental & Advanced Features (High - Very High Complexity)**

* **Goal:** Explore more advanced generation techniques and UI paradigms.
* **Rationale:** Push the boundaries of the tool's capabilities.

1.  **Frame Generation / Multi-Stage Workflow**
    * **Goal:** Generate a frame first, then generate content within it using edge detection/masking.
    * **Rationale:** Advanced composition technique.
    * **Implementation:** Requires a multi-step process interacting with ComfyUI:
        * **Step 1 (Frame Gen):** Queue a prompt specifically designed to generate *only* the desired frame style against a plain background.
        * **Step 2 (Get Frame Image):** Retrieve the generated frame image (via polling/view).
        * **Step 3 (Process Frame - Client or Server?):**
            * *Client-side (JS Canvas):* Load the frame image onto an HTML canvas, use JS image processing libraries to detect edges (e.g., Canny edge detection equivalent in JS) or perform color-keying to create a mask for the inner area. Create a faded/masked version. This is complex and potentially slow in the browser.
            * *Server-side (ComfyUI Custom Node):* Requires a custom ComfyUI node that takes the frame image, performs edge detection/masking/fading, and outputs the mask image.
        * **Step 4 (Inpaint Content):** Upload the original frame image and the generated mask image using `/upload/image`. Queue a *second* prompt (the main content prompt) using an **inpainting workflow** in ComfyUI, providing the original frame as the image input and the generated mask as the inpaint mask.
    * **Challenges:** Multi-stage prompt queuing and result handling, complex image processing (client or server), dynamic workflow modification or selection of specialized inpainting workflows.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`, `index.html` (UI for frame options?), potentially custom ComfyUI nodes.
    * **Complexity:** Very High.

2.  **Settings Comparison Tool**
    * **Goal:** Easily compare outputs using the same prompt/seed but varying one parameter (model, VAE, CFG, etc.).
    * **Rationale:** Useful for understanding parameter impact.
    * **Implementation:** Similar to batch mode, but requires more structured looping and result grouping.
        * **UI (`index.html`):** Add a new "Comparison Mode" section. Allow selecting *one* parameter to vary (e.g., dropdown for "Parameter to Vary": Model, CFG, Steps...). Provide inputs for the range/list of values for that parameter (e.g., text input for comma-separated CFG values: "5, 7, 9", or multi-select for models). Fix other parameters (prompt, seed - maybe allow fixing seed or using same random seed?).
        * **Logic (`script.js`):**
            * When "Start Comparison" is clicked, get the fixed parameters and the list of values for the varying parameter.
            * Loop through the list of varying values.
            * In each iteration, modify the `workflowToUse` JSON with the current value of the varying parameter.
            * Call `handleSendPromptToImageServices` for each variation, passing a specific run identifier (e.g., `compare-cfg-7-<timestamp>`).
            * **Result Display:** Modify the results grid or create a new comparison view to group results by the parameter value that was varied.
    * **Challenges:** Complex UI for selecting parameter and range, modifying different parts of the workflow dynamically based on selected parameter, organizing/displaying comparison results effectively.
    * **Affected Files:** `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`.
    * **Complexity:** High.

3.  **Skins / Visual Interfaces / Gamification**
    * **Goal:** Change the application's look and feel or add game-like elements.
    * **Rationale:** Improve user engagement or aesthetic appeal.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Skins:** Primarily CSS work. Define multiple CSS themes (e.g., `theme-dark.css`, `theme-light.css`, `theme-cyberpunk.css`). Add a UI element (dropdown) to select a theme. Use JS to dynamically add/remove a class on the `<body>` or main container element (e.g., `body.classList.add('theme-light')`) which triggers the theme-specific CSS rules.
        * **Gamification:** Depends heavily on the desired mechanics. Could involve points for generating prompts, unlocking new keyword categories, daily challenges, etc. Requires significant JS logic for tracking state, awarding points/achievements, and updating the UI accordingly. Might need `localStorage` to save progress.
    * **Affected Files:** `styles.css` (heavily for skins), `index.html` (theme selector, game elements), `script.js` (theme switching logic, game logic).
    * **Complexity:** Medium (for basic CSS skins) to Very High (for gamification).

**Phase 8: Code Quality & Maintenance (Ongoing)**

* **Goal:** Ensure the codebase remains maintainable, robust, and easy to understand as features are added.
* **Rationale:** Essential for long-term development and stability.

1.  **Enhance Error Handling & User Feedback**
    * **Goal:** Provide clearer, more specific error messages for all potential failure points (keyword generation, LLM calls, image endpoint calls, polling timeouts, image loading).
    * **Implementation:** Review all `catch` blocks and API response checks in `script.js`. Replace generic messages with more specific ones. Use the different message boxes (`mainMessageBox`, `configMessageBox`, `resultsMessageBox`) appropriately. Consider adding a dedicated, persistent status log area.
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js`.
    * **Complexity:** Medium (requires careful tracing of all error paths).

2.  **Refactor `script.js` (Potential Future)**
    * **Goal:** Improve code organization as the script grows.
    * **Rationale:** A single large JS file becomes hard to manage.
    * **Implementation:** If a build step (using tools like Webpack, Parcel, or Vite) is introduced later, refactor `script.js` into smaller, focused JavaScript modules (e.g., `ui.js`, `api.js`, `comfyui.js`, `storage.js`). Use ES6 `import`/`export` syntax. The build tool would then bundle these into a single file for deployment.
    * **Dependencies:** Introduction of a build process (outside current scope).
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js` (major refactor), build configuration files.
    * **Complexity:** High (requires setting up and configuring a build tool).

3.  **Improve State Management (Potential Future)**
    * **Goal:** Manage application state (selected keywords, configuration, results) more systematically.
    * **Rationale:** As features increase, passing state between functions or relying solely on reading DOM values becomes complex and error-prone.
    * **Implementation:** Introduce a simple state management object or potentially a mini-library/pattern. Define a central JavaScript object to hold the current state. Functions read from and write to this state object. Implement a way to update the UI whenever the state changes (e.g., a simple pub/sub pattern or manual UI updates after state changes).
    * **Affected Files:** `script.js` (significant refactoring).
    * **Complexity:** Medium to High.

4.  **Testing**
    * **Goal:** Ensure new features work correctly and don't break existing functionality.
    * **Implementation:** Manual testing is crucial at each stage. For a more robust approach (especially if refactoring or adding complex features), consider adding automated tests using frameworks like Jest or Vitest (requires Node.js environment and likely a build setup). Test different browsers.
    * **Complexity:** Low (for manual) / High (for automated).

---

# This detailed plan provides a roadmap. Items within Phase 1 & 2 are relatively straightforward. Phase 3-5 introduce more complex logic and UI interactions. Phase 6-7 involve significant architectural changes or advanced features that would require substantial effort. Phase 8 should be considered throughout the process. Remember to tackle items iteratively and test frequently!
